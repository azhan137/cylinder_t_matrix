Compute T-matrix and derivative of T-matrix

This is a routine for computing the T-matrix and T-matrix derivatives (with respect to radius and height) of a circular right cylinder using the Null Field Method. 

It is valid for moderate aspect ratios, and was written by Alan Zhan (azhan137@gmail.com)
